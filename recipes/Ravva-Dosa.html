    <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Ravva Dosa is a thin, crisp, lacy dosa made instantly from semolina (ravva), rice flour, and spices. Unlike traditional dosas, there's no fermentation needed — just mix, pour, and enjoy.</p>

<p>Speckled with cumin, green chilies, ginger, and sometimes onions or coriander, Ravva Dosa is crunchy, flavorful, and best enjoyed hot off the pan with coconut chutney or spicy tomato dip. A quick fix that never fails to impress.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 cup semolina (sooji/ravva)</li>
  <li>1/2 cup rice flour</li>
  <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
  <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
  <li>1–2 green chilies, chopped</li>
  <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
  <li>1 tsp grated ginger</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander leaves, chopped</li>
  <li>A few curry leaves, chopped</li>
  <li>Salt to taste</li>
  <li>2½ to 3 cups water (to make a thin batter)</li>
  <li>Oil or ghee for cooking</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparation Steps</h2>

<ol>
 <li>In a mixing bowl, combine semolina, rice flour, and all-purpose flour.</li>
  <li>Add chopped onions, green chilies, ginger, cumin, coriander leaves, curry leaves, and salt. Mix well.</li>
  <li>Pour in water gradually to make a thin, watery batter. Let it rest for 10–15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir well before using, as the mixture settles at the bottom.</li>
  <li>Heat a dosa tawa or non-stick pan until very hot. Splash the batter from the outside toward the center — do not spread like regular dosa.</li>
  <li>Drizzle oil or ghee around the edges and holes. Cook on medium-high heat until the edges lift and turn golden.</li>
  <li>Do not flip. Fold and serve hot with chutney or sambar.</li>
</ol>
