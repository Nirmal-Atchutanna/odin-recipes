<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Masala Dosa is a beloved South Indian dish known for its crisp golden exterior and flavorful spiced potato filling. It's traditionally served with coconut chutney and sambar, making it a complete and comforting meal.</p>

<p>Made from a fermented rice and lentil batter, the dosa is thin like a crepe, yet satisfying like a feast. Whether enjoyed as a street food snack or a hearty breakfast, it’s a timeless classic that balances crunch, spice, and soul.</p>
