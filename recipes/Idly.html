      <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Idly is a soft, fluffy, and steamed South Indian breakfast delicacy made from a fermented rice and urad dal batter. It’s light, wholesome, and pairs beautifully with coconut chutney and hot sambar.</p>
  
  <p>These pillowy rice cakes are a staple in every South Indian home — gentle on the stomach and full of tradition, steamed to perfection without a drop of oil.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups parboiled rice</li>
    <li>1 cup urad dal (split black gram)</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds (optional)</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Water for soaking and grinding</li>
    <li>Oil or ghee for greasing idly molds</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Rinse rice and urad dal separately. Soak rice and dal (with fenugreek seeds) in water for 4–6 hours.</li>
    <li>Grind urad dal to a smooth and fluffy batter. Grind rice to a slightly coarse batter.</li>
    <li>Mix both batters together in a large bowl. Add salt and mix well.</li>
    <li>Cover and let it ferment overnight or 8–12 hours, until the batter rises and turns airy.</li>
    <li>Grease idly molds and pour the batter into each slot.</li>
    <li>Steam for 10–12 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
    <li>Let cool for a minute, then remove idlies with a spoon.</li>
    <li>Serve hot with chutney, sambar, or podi (spiced lentil powder).</li>
  </ol>
